# pwdmanager
This open source password manager is based on framework of django-allauth, then I add the secret management system to it.

## Please create the `settings.py` by yourself
Remember to start your app after creating the project. Don't show your key in `settings.py` to any other people. I put the sample file of `settings.py` in subdirectory, take a look at `.sample_setting.py` if you have no ideas about it.
